# Flipper 2 Flipper Bluetooth Transfer

This application is currently still a work in progress and does not function properly on every compilation.

The purpose of this is to send and receive files between two flipper zeros. It uses Bluetooth and currently has a 1MB file size limit.

## Compilation

The compilation process requries the flipper zero SDK and firmware to set up the build environment.

Detailed steps for compilation will be added once the code functions properly.
